description = """Software for Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution

The purpose of CAFE is to analyze changes in gene family size in a way that
accounts for phylogenetic history and provides a statistical foundation for
evolutionary inferences. The program uses a birth and death process to model
gene gain and loss across a user-specified phylogenetic tree. The distribution
of family sizes generated under this model can provide a basis for assessing the
significance of the observed family size differences among taxa."""
