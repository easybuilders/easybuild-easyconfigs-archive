description = """The rootpy project is a community-driven initiative aiming to
provide a more pythonic interface with ROOT on top of the existing
PyROOT bindings. Given Pythonâ€™s reflective and dynamic nature, rootpy
also aims to improve ROOT design flaws and supplement existing ROOT
functionality. The scientific Python community also offers a multitude
of powerful packages such as SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn,
and PyTables, but a suitable interface between them and ROOT has been
lacking. rootpy provides the interfaces and conversion mechanisms
required to liberate your data and to take advantage of these
alternatives if needed."""
